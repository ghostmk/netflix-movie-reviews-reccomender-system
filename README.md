Netflix provided a lot of anonymous rating data, and a prediction accuracy bar that is 10% better than what Cinematch can do on the same training data set. (Accuracy is a measurement of how closely predicted ratings of movies match subsequent actual ratings.)

Objectives:

Predict the rating that a user would give to a movie that he has not yet rated.
Minimize the difference between predicted and actual rating (RMSE and MAPE)
